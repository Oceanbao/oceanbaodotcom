Which one should we use? It might seem like an inconsequential decision, but there are some pretty important differences between them. And, honestly, I think most of us are prioritizing the wrong things. ðŸ˜…

In this tutorial, I'll take you on a tour of the different options. We'll see how they work, how we can decipher them, and how we can use them to our advantage. Later, I'll show you how modern CSS lets us make on-the-fly adjustments, if we pick the right color format.
